# MESA - Mapping Environmentally Sensitive Assets
MESA is a standardised methodology that was developed following a review of multiple existing methods. It provides a step-by-step protocol for evaluating environmental sensitivity of assets, combined with an FME-based tool for processing and QGIS for aggregating and visualising data. A guidance document accompanies the tool to enable any interested individuals in using MESA to produce environmental sensitivity atlases.
